ğŸ‘‰ Jenkins is a Java application, so the first step is to install Java. Run the following command to install the OpenJDK 8 package
sudo yum install java-1.8.0-openjdk-devel
 
ğŸ‘‰ The next step is to enable the Jenkins repository. To do that, import the GPG key using the following curl command
curl --silent --location http://pkg.jenkins-ci.org/redhat-stable/jenkins.repo | sudo tee /etc/yum.repos.d/jenkins.repo

ğŸ‘‰ And add the repository to your system with
sudo rpm --import https://jenkins-ci.org/redhat/jenkins-ci.org.key

ğŸ‘‰ Once the repository is enabled, install the latest stable version of Jenkins by typing
sudo yum install jenkins

ğŸ‘‰ After the installation process is completed, start the Jenkins service with:
sudo systemctl start jenkins

ğŸ‘‰ To check whether it started successfully run:
systemctl status jenkins

ğŸ‘‰ Finally enable the Jenkins service to start on system boot:
sudo systemctl enable jenkins

ğŸ‘‰ Adjust the firewall with:
sudo firewall-cmd --permanent --zone=public --add-port=8080/tcp
sudo firewall-cmd --reload

ğŸ‘‰ To set up your new Jenkins installation, open your browser and type your domain or IP address followed by port 8080
http://your_ip_or_domain:8080

ğŸ‘‰ Use the following command to print the password on your terminal:
sudo cat /var/lib/jenkins/secrets/initialAdminPassword

ğŸ‘‰ Copy the password from your terminal, paste it into the Administrator password field and click Continue.

ğŸ‘‰ On the next screen, you will be asked whether you want to install the suggested plugins or to select specific plugins. 

ğŸ‘‰ Click on the Install suggested plugins box, and the installation process will start immediately.

ğŸ‘‰ Once the installation is complete, you will be prompted to set up the first administrative user. 

ğŸ‘‰ Fill out all required information and click Save and Continue.

ğŸ‘‰On the next page, you will be asked to set the URL for the Jenkins instance. 

ğŸ‘‰ The URL field will be populated with an automatically generated URL.
 
ğŸ‘‰ To complete the setup confirm the URL by clicking on the Save and Finish button.
